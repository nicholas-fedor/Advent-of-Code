## ScrapeText -> main.go
Colly web-scraping that saves output as .txt files.
Outputs to "Data/Text" directory separated by year and day.

## ScrapeHTML -> main.go
GoQuery web-scraping that saves output at .html files.
Outputs to "Data/HTML" directory separated by year and day.
Generates index.html files for each year and a primary index.html file linking
to each year.

## Solutions
Each day has two separate parts that are completed sequentially.
The scrapers only get the first parts.

I will attempt to figure out a decent format for including the prompts for both
parts in the solutions directory.
